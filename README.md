  The general game is different in that the goal is to complete the most “SOS” combinations possible. The game ends when the board is full. The player with the most combinations wins. The game is considered a draw if there are no combinations made or if there are an equal number of combinations made between both players. The game starts with the blue player. If a piece is placed that forms an “SOS” the player can make another move during their turn. The turn is switched if a move is made with no “SOS” combinations
